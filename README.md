Overview
This is a web-based implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, created using Vanilla JavaScript. The game features simple mechanics where the player controls a bird, guiding it through a series of obstacles by clicking or tapping to keep the bird airborne. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without hitting them or falling to the ground.
